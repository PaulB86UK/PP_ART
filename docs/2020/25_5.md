# Monday 25th of May of 2020

### Today I corrected some mistakes I made in the code & processing, and also started on working with the object columns (Cabin for example).

## Fixing some errors and omission from yesterday work 

Hello World!. Looking at the job I did yesterday I realized I did not consider converting the sex and embarked data into numerical values for the reorder function I created. Also I miss filling one value for the Fare that was missing and finally I dropped all 'NaN' rows in the database (from the Cabin column). Lastly, I corrected the Reorder function,in order to avoid an out of range error, I limited the variable range to be lower than 30 inside the function. 


The code I used is the following

```python
#Make Embarked numerical and complete Fare and Embarked

age_train['fare'].fillna(age_train['fare'].median(), inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].fillna('S', inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('Q', 0,inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('C', 1,inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('S', 2,inplace=True)

age_test['fare'].fillna(age_test['fare'].median(),inplace = True)
age_test['embarked'].fillna('S', inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('Q', 0,inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('C', 1,inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('S', 2,inplace=True)

#Drop Target
age_train.drop('survived',axis =1, inplace = True)
age_test.drop('survived', axis =1, inplace = True)
age_train.dropna(inplace = True)
age_test.dropna(inplace = True)
```
## Working with the Cabin Column.
The idea is to keep the first letter of the data, and see how it correlates with the age. So first, I removed the NaN rows, and worked out some code, to keep only the first letter and made a new column with the results.
The code used is the following:

```python
cabin = age_train['cabin']
cabinletter = []
for i in cabin:
  cabinletter.append(i[0])
age_train['1_c_letter'] = cabinletter
```
### The question I am looking to answer is...
### Is there is any relation between the first letter of the Cabin Column data and the Age Range?
First I have to convert the 1st letter in a number, so in order to do that...

```python
def letter_to_number(df,col):
  letras = ['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W','X','Y','Z']
  numeros = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]
  C_1_Number = []
  for i in df[col]:
    pos = letras.index(i)
    C_1_Number.append(numeros[pos])
  return C_1_Number
  
age_train['cnumber'] = letter_to_number(age_train,'1_c_letter')
```
And now check the correlation between the new feature cnumber with the age
```python
correlations = age_train.corrwith(age_train['age']).iloc[:].to_frame()
correlations['abs'] = correlations[0].abs()
sorted_correlations = correlations.sort_values('abs', ascending=False)[0]
sorted_correlations
```
And the result was ...

```python
pclass        -0.338609
cnumber       -0.168929 ---> The new feature
parch         -0.161293
sex           -0.108762
passengerid    0.108601
sibsp         -0.080816
embarked      -0.077708
fare           0.013872
Name: 0, dtype: float64
```
Which is the 2nd most important feature related to age, **so its an important addition to help building the model**.

The complete code can be seen in this [Link:](https://github.com/PaulB86UK/EDA_PP/blob/master/EDA_Reorder_24_5_20.ipynb)
There is a good graphical example of the functionality of the reorder function with the new feature cnumber, check it!.

Finally I thought that the numbers next to the letter of the Cabin might be useful for later. For example they, altogether with the cnumber column, might represent an X,Y location in the Tytanic, and the X,Y pairs could be highly correlated with the Survive column which is the major objective. For this reason I prepared a new column with the 3 following digits after the letter.

You might check the final version(with no graphical example, and in Colaboratory) in the following [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ac8hLFzFF8tFo63QuJNumGY4V6t1d-Qj?usp=sharing)
