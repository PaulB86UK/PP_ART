# Monday 25th of May of 2020

### Following the idea of fixing the object features in the dataframe I continued working with the name & ticket columns.

## Name Column. 
My strategy here was to count every word from all the rows/string in the column, and from the ones that had a higher frequency select the ones that had a significant correlation with the target at this stage, the Age. To perform the task I worked out the following code, which after some tuning, became a function. Hope you like this code, its the first time I did something like this(I usually don't work with strings).

```python
#Column Name Operations
def ty_name():
  #Generating a dictionary with the strings repetition
  counts = dict()
  def word_count(str):
      words = str.split()
      for word in words:
          if word in counts:
              counts[word] += 1
          else:
              counts[word] = 1

  for i in age_train['name']:
    word_count(i)
  #and convert the dictionary into a dataframe and obviously order it by freq
  tabla = pd.DataFrame(counts.items(), columns=['string','frequency'])
  tabla_finita = tabla[tabla['frequency'] > 5]
  tabla_finita = tabla_finita.sort_values(by= 'frequency', ascending = False)
  #So now I have an idea the words that repeat among the names that I can try to check against the age.
  #And my own version of get dummies but for name pieces :D. 
  for i in tabla_finita['string']:
    lesta = []
    for j in age_train['name']:
      if i in j:
        lesta.append(1)
      else:
        lesta.append(0)
    age_train[i] = lesta
```
