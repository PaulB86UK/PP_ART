# Monday 25th of May of 2020

### Following the idea of fixing the object features in the dataframe I continued working with the name & ticket columns.

## Column: Name. 
My strategy here was to count every word from all the rows/string in the column, and from the ones that had a higher frequency select the ones that had a significant correlation with the target at this stage, the Age. To perform the task I worked out the following code, which after some tuning, became a function. Hope you like this code, its the first time I do something like this(I usually don't work with strings).

```python
#Column Name Operations
def ty_name():
  #Generating a dictionary with the strings repetition
  counts = dict()
  def word_count(str):
      words = str.split()
      for word in words:
          if word in counts:
              counts[word] += 1
          else:
              counts[word] = 1

  for i in age_train['name']:
    word_count(i)
  #and convert the dictionary into a dataframe and obviously order it by freq
  tabla = pd.DataFrame(counts.items(), columns=['string','frequency'])
  tabla_finita = tabla[tabla['frequency'] > 5]
  tabla_finita = tabla_finita.sort_values(by= 'frequency', ascending = False)
  #So now I have an idea the words that repeat among the names that I can try to check against the age.
  #And my own version of get dummies but for name pieces :D. 
  for i in tabla_finita['string']:
    lesta = []
    for j in age_train['name']:
      if i in j:
        lesta.append(1)
      else:
        lesta.append(0)
    age_train[i] = lesta
```
So in this code, I only use the words that appear more than 5 times. The correlation selection is made when the function reorder() is triggered(not shown here, but can be seen in the repository, or previous post in the blog)

## Column: Ticket. 
Similar to the cabin, this column had letters/numbers in some rows, and only numbers in others.
So the first step I did was to check all the strings that appear in every row, and asign each of them a number, make a list and create a new column.
After that I removed using the [ord](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=ord#ord)] and [translate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=translate#str.translate) python built-in functions the characters 'WPCS/.EOTFARI ' from the ticket column. 
Finally, I created another list, and asigned it to a new column. The code I used to perform both tasks is the following:

```python
def ty_ticket():
  #now the ticket columnn
   pc = []
  for i in age_train.ticket:
    if 'PC' in i:
      pc.append(1)
    elif 'PP' in i:
      pc.append(2)
    elif 'SC/P' in i:
      pc.append(3)
    elif 'C.A.' in i:
      pc.append(4)
    elif 'W.E.P.' in i:
      pc.append(5)
    elif 'SC/AH' in i:
      pc.append(6)  
    elif 'SOTON/O' in i:
      pc.append(7)
    elif 'F.C.' in i:
      pc.append(8)
    elif 'WE/P' in i:
      pc.append(9)
    elif 'S.O./P.' in i:
      pc.append(10)
    elif 'W./C.' in i:
      pc.append(11)
    elif 'aris' in i:
      pc.append(11)
    elif 'NQ' in i:
      pc.append(12)
    elif 'HBle' in i:
      pc.append(12)
    else:
      pc.append(0)
  age_train['PC'] = pc
  age_train['PC'] = age_train['PC'].astype(int)

  lesta = []
  for i in age_train.ticket:
    j = i.translate({ord(k): None for k in 'WPCS/.EOTFARINQHBlearis '})
    lesta.append(j)
  age_train['Ticket2'] = lesta
```
## Results
### How was the correlation between the features analized with the variable 'Age'?
As it can be seen from the table below, some of the words in the rows of the column name had strong correlation with the age, such Miss., Mr.,Mrs., as it was expected, but also names as Edward or Henry happened to show also some correlation.
Regarding the ticket column, only the number in the ticket shows correlation, while the letters on it did not. However the letter might be important later, when analizing and preparing the final model to predict if the person survived or not.

```python
Master.       -0.377010
pclass         0.338609
Miss.         -0.301639
