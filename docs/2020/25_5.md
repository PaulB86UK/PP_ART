# Monday 25th of May of 2020

### Following the idea of fixing the object features in the dataframe I continued working with the name & ticket columns.

## Name Column. 
My strategy here was to count every word from all the rows/string in the column, and from the ones that had a higher frequency select the ones that had a significant correlation with the target at this stage, the Age. To perform the task I worked out the following code, which after some tuning, became a function. Hope you like this code, its the first time I do something like this(I usually don't work with strings).

```python
#Column Name Operations
def ty_name():
  #Generating a dictionary with the strings repetition
  counts = dict()
  def word_count(str):
      words = str.split()
      for word in words:
          if word in counts:
              counts[word] += 1
          else:
              counts[word] = 1

  for i in age_train['name']:
    word_count(i)
  #and convert the dictionary into a dataframe and obviously order it by freq
  tabla = pd.DataFrame(counts.items(), columns=['string','frequency'])
  tabla_finita = tabla[tabla['frequency'] > 5]
  tabla_finita = tabla_finita.sort_values(by= 'frequency', ascending = False)
  #So now I have an idea the words that repeat among the names that I can try to check against the age.
  #And my own version of get dummies but for name pieces :D. 
  for i in tabla_finita['string']:
    lesta = []
    for j in age_train['name']:
      if i in j:
        lesta.append(1)
      else:
        lesta.append(0)
    age_train[i] = lesta
```
So in this code, I only use the words that appear more than 5 times. The correlation selection is made when the function reorder() is triggered(not shown here, but can be seen in the repository, or previous post in the blog)

## Ticket Column. 
Similar to the cabin, this column had letters/numbers in some rows, and only numbers in others.
So the first step I did was to check all the strings that appear in every row, and asign each of them a number, make a list and create a new column.
After that I removed using the [ord](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=ord#ord)] and [translate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=translate#str.translate) python built-in functions the characters 'WPCS/.EOTFARI ' from the ticket column. Finally, I created another list, and asigned it to a different column.
The code I used to perform both tasks is the following:

```python
def ty_ticket():
  #now the ticket columnn
  pc = []
  for i in age_train.ticket:
    if 'PC' in i:
      pc.append(1)
    elif 'PP' in i:
      pc.append(2)
    elif 'SC/P' in i:
      pc.append(3)
    elif 'C.A.' in i:
      pc.append(4)
    elif 'W.E.P.' in i:
      pc.append(5)
    elif 'SC/AH' in i:
      pc.append(6)  
    elif 'SOTON/O' in i:
      pc.append(7)
    elif 'F.C.' in i:
      pc.append(8)
    elif 'WE/P' in i:
      pc.append(9)
    elif 'S.O./P.' in i:
      pc.append(10)
    elif 'W./C.' in i:
      pc.append(11)
    else:
      pc.append(0)
  age_train['PC'] = pc
  age_train['PC'] = age_train['PC'].astype(int)

  lesta = []
  for i in age_train.ticket:
    j = i.translate({ord(k): None for k in 'WPCS/.EOTFARI '})
    lesta.append(j)
  age_train['Ticket2'] = lesta
```
Checking the results of processing the Ticket, I found that 'PC' column did not correlated well with age, but it might be good for the Survive/Not Survive modelling later on.
