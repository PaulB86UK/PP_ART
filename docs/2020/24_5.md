# Sunday 24th of May of 2020

Hello World!. Looking at the job I did yesterday I realized I did not consider converting the sex and embarked data into numerical values for the reorder function I created. Also I miss filling one value for the Fare that was missing and finally I dropped all 'NaN' rows in the database (from the Cabin column)/

The code I used is the following

```python
#Make Embarked numerical and complete Fare and Embarked

age_train['fare'].fillna(age_train['fare'].median(), inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].fillna('S', inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('Q', 0,inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('C', 1,inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('S', 2,inplace=True)

age_test['fare'].fillna(age_test['fare'].median(),inplace = True)
age_test['embarked'].fillna('S', inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('Q', 0,inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('C', 1,inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('S', 2,inplace=True)

#Drop Target
age_train.drop('survived',axis =1, inplace = True)
age_test.drop('survived', axis =1, inplace = True)
age_train.dropna(inplace = True)
age_test.dropna(inplace = True)
```
