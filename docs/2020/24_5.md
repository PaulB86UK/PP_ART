# Sunday 24th of May of 2020

### Today I corrected some mistakes I made in the code & processing, and also started on working with the object columns (Cabin for example).

## Fixing some errors and omission from yesterday work 

Hello World!. Looking at the job I did yesterday I realized I did not consider converting the sex and embarked data into numerical values for the reorder function I created. Also I miss filling one value for the Fare that was missing and finally I dropped all 'NaN' rows in the database (from the Cabin column). Lastly, I corrected the Reorder function,in order to avoid an out of range error, I limited the variable range to be lower than 30 inside the function. 


The code I used is the following

```python
#Make Embarked numerical and complete Fare and Embarked

age_train['fare'].fillna(age_train['fare'].median(), inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].fillna('S', inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('Q', 0,inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('C', 1,inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('S', 2,inplace=True)

age_test['fare'].fillna(age_test['fare'].median(),inplace = True)
age_test['embarked'].fillna('S', inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('Q', 0,inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('C', 1,inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('S', 2,inplace=True)

#Drop Target
age_train.drop('survived',axis =1, inplace = True)
age_test.drop('survived', axis =1, inplace = True)
age_train.dropna(inplace = True)
age_test.dropna(inplace = True)
```
## Working with the Cabin Column.
The idea is to keep the first letter of the data, and see how it correlates with the age. So first, I removed the NaN rows, and worked out some code, to keep only the first letter and made a new column with the results.
The code used is the following:

```python
cabin = age_train['cabin']
cabinletter = []
for i in cabin:
  cabinletter.append(i[0])
age_train['1_c_letter'] = cabinletter
```
### The question I am looking to answer is...
### Is there is any relation between the first letter of the Cabin Column data and the Age Range?
First I have to convert the 1st letter in a number, so in order to do that...

```python
def letter_to_number(df,col):
  letras = ['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W','X','Y','Z']
  numeros = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]
  C_1_Number = []
  for i in df[col]:
    pos = letras.index(i)
    C_1_Number.append(numeros[pos])
  return C_1_Number
  
age_train['cnumber'] = letter_to_number(age_train,'1_c_letter')
```
And now check the correlation between the new feature cnumber with the age/
```python
correlations = age_train.corrwith(age_train['age']).iloc[:].to_frame()
correlations['abs'] = correlations[0].abs()
sorted_correlations = correlations.sort_values('abs', ascending=False)[0]
sorted_correlations
```
And the result was ...

```python
pclass        -0.338609
cnumber       -0.168929 ---> The new feature
parch         -0.161293
sex           -0.108762
passengerid    0.108601
sibsp         -0.080816
embarked      -0.077708
fare           0.013872
Name: 0, dtype: float64
```
Which is the 2nd most important feature related to age, **so its an important addition to help building the model**.

Finally to show the functionality of the reorder function from yesterday, this is how the new feature looks before and after the transformation.
