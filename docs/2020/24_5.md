## Fixing some errors and omission from yesterday work 

Hello World!. Looking at the job I did yesterday I realized I did not consider converting the sex and embarked data into numerical values for the reorder function I created. Also I miss filling one value for the Fare that was missing and finally I dropped all 'NaN' rows in the database (from the Cabin column). Lastly, I corrected the Reorder function,in order to avoid an out of range error, I limited the variable range to be lower than 30 inside the function, so when its a continuos variable its not processed (not enough letters haha)


The code I used is the following

```python
#Make Embarked numerical and complete Fare and Embarked

age_train['fare'].fillna(age_train['fare'].median(), inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].fillna('S', inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('Q', 0,inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('C', 1,inplace=True)
age_train['embarked'].replace('S', 2,inplace=True)

age_test['fare'].fillna(age_test['fare'].median(),inplace = True)
age_test['embarked'].fillna('S', inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('Q', 0,inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('C', 1,inplace=True)
age_test['embarked'].replace('S', 2,inplace=True)

#Drop Target
age_train.drop('survived',axis =1, inplace = True)
age_test.drop('survived', axis =1, inplace = True)
age_train.dropna(inplace = True)
age_test.dropna(inplace = True)
```
## Working with the Cabin Column.
The idea is to keep the first letter of the data, and see how it correlates with the age. So first, I removed the NaN rows, and worked out some code, to keep only the first letter and made a new column with the results.
The code used is the following:

```python
cabin = age_train['cabin']
cabinletter = []
for i in cabin:
  cabinletter.append(i[0])
age_train['1_c_letter'] = cabinletter
```
