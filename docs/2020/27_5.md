# Wednesday 27th of May of 2020
Today I prepared some code to train XGboost with the dataset created, after fine tunning I choose a good performing model and use it to complete the missing age rows. **Pandas, Sklearn and XGboost** were the used libraries in this opportunity.

## XGBoost - Fine Tuning
Since I do not have enough computing power, I have to do the tuning in several steps (I call them rounds). I always try to be a little conservative in order to avoid building a overfitting model.

### First Round
Everything is in the following code: I fixed some parameters in the xgb_clf definition. And using a loop and the Gridsearch I explored the R2 scores of different combinations changing the CV number, the number of estimators, and the max_depth. I am showing only one iteration in the code.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold
from xgboost import XGBRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer

r2_scorer = make_scorer(r2_score,greater_is_better=True, needs_proba=False, needs_threshold=False)
xgb_clf = XGBRegressor(booster = 'dart', sampling_method = 'gradient_based', objective = 'reg:logistic', n_gpus = -1, eta = 0.6, nthread = 4, eval_metric = 'auc', gamma = 1, verbose = 0)
for i in range(2,25): 
  parameters= {'max_depth':[2,4], 'learning_rate':[0.001],'n_estimators':[400,800]}
  XG_CLF= GridSearchCV(xgb_clf, parameters, n_jobs=-1, refit=True, cv=i, verbose=False, scoring= r2_scorer)
  XG_CLF.fit(X_t,y2)
  print('\nThe CV is: ' + str(i))
  XG_Res = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(XG_CLF.cv_results_["params"]),pd.DataFrame(XG_CLF.cv_results_["mean_test_score"], columns=["Score"])],axis=1)
  XG_Res = XG_Res.sort_values(by='Score',ascending=False)
  print(XG_Res.head(3))
```
