# About

My name is Pablo Puente, I have recently arrived in the United Kingdom, to work and study, hopefully, will be starting my MSc in Data Science in Middlesex in September. I have a degree in Biotechnology, with a Specialization in Sanitary engineering, 7 years of professional experience and 3 years of academic research. I really enjoy the challenge of working with data, fitting models and getting insights. I started to learn Data Science on my own last year, and from then never stopped. I started in March/April 2020 thanks to COVID "free time" this blog/page/portfolio to keep track of my Data Science related work.
