### Titanic Dataset Age Data Features Fitting  
#### Fixing Columns for filling age missing values

Good Monday!. At this point I continued working with the remaining object features from the dataset: **Name** and **Ticket**. I did not remember having worked with string like this before, you should check the code, I believe its a nice one!.

### Titanic Dataset Age Data Features Fitting  
#### Fixing Columns for filling age missing values

Hello!, Today I checked yesterday work, and continue in the same objective, fixing some omisions from yesterday, and also started to work on the object columns, in order to see how to convert them into numbers that make sense for the model I will try to build later on.

### Titanic Dataset Age Data Features Fitting - Reorder.

Today I worked out some code to fix the numerical values of the features relevant to the Age column of the Tytanic Dataset. **Pandas** and **Seaborn** were the used libraries in this opportunity.
