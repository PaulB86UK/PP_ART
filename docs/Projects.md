# Some Projects

## COVID Community Mobility Reports
*Trying to gain a little more experience on Tableau, I used some lockdown spare time to make a Dashboard, and while checking which data was trending, I found some interesting google location data trends made public to help with the virus outbreak.*

## Time Series with Neural Networks: Predicting Bitcoin Price
*Time series forecasting is an important area of machine learning that is often neglected. It is important because there are so many prediction problems that involve a time component. These problems are neglected because it is this time component that makes time series problems more difficult to handle.In this Project I will project I will work with the LSTM & RNN Recurrent Neural Networks for Time-Series Analisis to build a model for Bitcoin Price Prediction.*
