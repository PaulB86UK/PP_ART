# Hello World!
## Introduction

My name is Pablo Puente, I started in April/May 2020 thanks to COVID "free time" this blog/page/portfolio to keep track of my Data-Science-related work.

## A little more about me
I arrived in January to the United Kingdom to work and study, hopefully, I will be starting my MSc in Data Science in September. I have a degree in Biotechnology, with a Specialization in Sanitary engineering, 7 years of professional experience and 3 years of academic research. Last year, I started to learn Data Science (on my own), and from that time I never stopped.
