My name is Pablo Puente, I have recently arrived in the United Kingdom, to work and study, hopefully, will be starting my MSc in Data Science in Middlesex in September. I have a degree in Biotechnology, with a Specialization in Sanitary engineering, 7 years of professional experience and 3 years of academic research. Actually looking to land in my first data analysis Job in London.  
I really enjoy the challenge of working with data, fitting models and getting insights. Actually looking to land in my first data analysis Job in London.
