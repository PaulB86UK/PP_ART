          Trying to gain a little more experience on Tableau, I used some lockdown spare time to make a Dashboard, and while checking which data was trending, and in my way of trying to be a little more original than using the number of infected, recovered, etc, I found some interesting google location data trends made public to help with the virus outbreak.

          <p>
          Time series forecasting is an important area of machine learning that is often neglected. It is important because there are so many prediction problems that involve a time component. These problems are neglected because it is this time component that makes time series problems more difficult to handle.<pre></pre>In this Project I will project I will work with the LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks for Time-Series Analisis to predict the Bitcoin Price.
