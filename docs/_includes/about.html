                My name is Pablo Puente, I have recently arrived in the United Kingdom, to work and study, 
                hopefully, will be starting my MSc in Data Science in Middlesex in September. 
                I have a degree in Biotechnology, with a Specialization in Sanitary engineering, 
                7 years of professional experience and 3 years of academic research.
                Actually looking to land in my first data analysis Job in London.

                I have started programming, on my own (thanks to YouTube) in the last years when I was running short with excel for data analysis for both my Job and the water specialization. From basic regression models to making a convolutional neural network to predict open channels in cells by measuring electrical signals (the last Kaggle competition, I am trying to tackle) I really enjoy the challenge of working with data, fitting models and getting insights.
